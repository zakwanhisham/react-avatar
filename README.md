# React-Avatar
React-avatar is a project that make the avatar that is similar to the one on GitHub

## Setup
1. Create a GitHub repository and clone it by using `git clone git@github:<username>/<repository-name>`
2. Create a Vite+React using `yarn create vite --template react-ts` inside your directory
3. Install the dependencies with `yarn` and run the project with `yarn dev`
4. Run test by using `yarn test`. This will create a watchable test 

## Notes
- I think we can use pnpm by using `pnpm create vite --template react-ts` and we can run it by using `pnpm install` then `pnpm run dev`
